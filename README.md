This repo is to document the mapping of EcoTaxa data fields with Darwin Core terms and how they can be organized into the OBIS-ENV-DATA format. At the WWW.PIC technical kick-off meeting, 9-10 July 2019 (Paris) we agreed on the following minimal terms.

ECOTAXA | Darwin Core
--- | :---
object_id  | dwc:occurrenceID
object_lat | dwc:decimalLatitude
object_lon | decimalLongitude
